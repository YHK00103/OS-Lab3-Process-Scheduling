## HW3-2 Round-Robin
Example: (Time Quantum = 3)

## HW3-3 Multilevel Feedbck Queue (RR+FCFS)
1. Processes in lower priority queue is selected if the higher queues are empty.  
2. If a new process comes to higher priority queue, currently executing process in lower priority queue will be preempted by it.  
3. When a new job comes, it first enters queue ùëÑ0 which is served as RR. As it gains CPU, job receives ‚Äút‚Äù time unit.   
4. If it doesn‚Äôt finish in ‚Äút‚Äù time unit, job is moved to the next queue ùëÑ1 which is served as FCFS.  
5. The preempted process will be re-inserted to the end of Q1
